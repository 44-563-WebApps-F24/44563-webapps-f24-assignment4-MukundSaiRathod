            <p><h5>THE.</h5> Why sounds again from hence your joint appeal,
            Wherein the strangerâ€™s voice is loudly heard?
            Is it some lightning-bolt new-fallen from Zeus,
            Or cloud-born hail that is come rattling down?
            From Heavens so black with storm nought can surprise. </p>
         
            <p><h5>OED.</h5> Prince, thou art come to my desire. Some God
            Hath happily directed this thy way.</p>
        
            <p><h5>THE.</h5> What is befallen? Son of Laius, tell!</p>
            
            <p><h5>OED.</h5> My path slopes downward, and before my death
            I would confirm to Athens and to thee
            My promised boon.</p>
            
            <p><h5>THE.</h5> What sign dost thou perceive
            That proves thine end so near?</p>
            
            <p><h5>OED.</h5>  The Gods themselves
            With herald voices are proclaiming it,
            Nought failing of the fore-appointed signs.</p>
            
            <p><h5>THE.</h5> What are these tokens, aged monarch, say?</p>
            
            <p><h5>OED.</h5> The loud continual thunder, and the darts
            That flash in volleys from the unconquered hand.</p>
